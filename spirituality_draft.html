<h1 class="page-title">Inner Meditation--Balanced Body and Mind</h1>
</div>

<div class="page-introduction">
<p>
We have described <a href="/#spirituality">a highly simplified version</a> of how inner meditation improves health, maintains wellness, and fulfills spirituality.

One of the central links is life energy, or called <em>qi</em> (pronounce CHEE) in inner meditation traditions.

<div class="page-section">
<h2 class="section-title">Life Energy--Qi</h2>
<p>
Qi is rather abstract for people who have not experienced or perceived it, however many other people can feel it after some time of practice.

Indeed, it can be elusive even for people who have done meditation for years.

We are attempting to explain it here from the practice point of view, i.e., how to start feel and cultivate it in meditation practices.

We hope that biologists and doctors can explain and quantify it in the future.
