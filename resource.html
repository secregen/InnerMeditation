Inner meditation regards the body as fundamental building materials for good overall wellness and spiritual advances.

Therefore, methods that exercise the body can assist and be beneficial to inner meditation practices.

These are some example exercises, but not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Tai Ji</li>
  <li>Yoga</li>
  <li>Martial arts</li>
  <li>Sport</li>
  <li>Workout</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Just like doing any body work, keeping good forms is extremely important in any of those exercises.
