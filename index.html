There are many good meditation practices, and a particular type is inner meditation.
<!---->
Unlike some techniques that use music or imagination of external images to help meditating, inner meditation emphasizes focusing on internal parts of a human body, looking at them and listening to them, namely, concentrating inward on something, not outside.
<!---->
It applies few fundamental techniques in concert, which include breath, concentration, relaxation, body postures, and mental power to develop life energy, or <em>qi</em>.
<!---->
The development of qi inside one's body enhances overall wellness of health and leads to a path of spiritual enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
Bringing all attention inward will cause profound changes to our body and mind gradually.
<!---->
It develops a human's awareness.
<!---->
Being aware of internal states of the body and mind is of great power, because it represents the ability of transforming one's negative emotion to positive energy.
<!---->
When combined with conscious will power, the awareness itself is one of the most effective ways to cultivate life energy or qi; the qi in turns enhances the ability of being aware.
<!---->
Of course, it also has relatively well-known benefits that one can obtain through meditation such as heartsease and enhanced concentration power.

<h2 class="section-title">Important Body Places</h2>
<p>
Several parts of the body play very important roles in inner meditation, and they are the places on which we concentrate our full attention.

One place is the bottom of the torso, centered around the perineum, which is also a meridian point.

A second place is the spine.

A third place is the <em>dan tian</em>, also called the center of the body, which is located behind the navel or the belly button and close to the spine.

Other places include the heart, the center of the brain, the top of the skull, and the central thrusting channel which goes up from the perineum to the top of the skull.
</p>


<p>
  Not all of these places are used together at the beginning of practices.

  Basic practices normally involve the perineum, the spine, and the dan tian.

  Others are targets of more advanced practices.

<h3 class="section-subtitle">Organs</h3>
<p>
Organs also play an important role in inner meditation because they are tightly connected to emotion and subtle psychological activities.

The organs that we meditate about are the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.

<h2 class="section-title">Basic Practices</h2>

<p>Inner meditation has a broad range of practices, and we do not even attempt to present a comprehensive list of concrete methods.

However, they do share some common characteristics which we discuss later.
<!-- on the <a href="/resource/">Resource</a> page.
-->

<p>In order to give a concrete picture of what an inner meditation practice may look like, this section describes one of the simplest but extremely powerful methods: the Yin Yang Breath.

It roughly consists of the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Prepare a good body posture that emphasizes an upright and straight spine, a smiling face, and a relaxed whole body.

<li>
  <img src="images/taiji-blue-red.png" id="img-taiji" height="200"
        alt="yin yang breath as if in tain ji"/>
Become aware of your breath and know the inhalation and exhalation process.

Elongate the exhalation process by making it more slowly than normal.

Meanwhile focus all intention on perineum.

At the end of exhalation, hold the breath for 5-10 seconds, and then release the entire body to let it inhale naturally.

When the body starts the next cycle of breath, repeat the same procedure, i.e., your breath flows smoothly like an endless whirlpool with the following pattern: exhale slowly, hold your breath, and inhale naturally; exhale slowly, hold your breath, and inhale naturally...

This is so called the yin breath because the attention and awareness concentrate with the exhalation process.

After some time, go to the next step.

<li>Lengthen the inhalation process by making it slowly, and meanwhile focus all intention on perineum.

At the end of inhalation, hold the breath for 5-10 seconds, and then release the entire body to let it exhale naturally.

When the body starts the next cycle of breath, repeat the same procedure.

This pattern swaps the inhalation and exhalation processes described in the previous step.

This is the yang breath because the attention and awareness become focused with the inhalation process.

This step is normally as twice long as the yin breath.

<li>Finish up.

Be aware of the breath and let it go naturally, and use both hands to cover the navel.

Keep the entire body relaxed.

For male, circle both hands around the navel 36 times counterclockwise and then 36 times in the opposite direction.

For female, circle clockwise first and then counterclockwise.
</ol>
</p>


<p>
Another example technique is the inner smile, which involves meditating about each organ mentioned above and transforms negative emotion into positive energy.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> just like learning any body or mind related work it may not be beneficial or even risky if you learn on your own because you may not practice with the right form or technique.

The most effective way of learning such skill is studying from an instructor in person, so that any inappropriate movements can be corrected promptly.

<h2 class="section-title">Levels of Inner Meditation</h2>

<p>From above description, you might have observed that inner meditation starts with some basic body exercises such as breath, body postures, etc. assisted with a concentrated brain.

This is exactly the case.

Inner meditation regards a human body as the fundamental building material for higher level spiritual development.

Mind activities including spiritual experience are also results of brain activities, and the brain is just an organ of our body which needs energy in order to function.

When the brain has more energy, it works better and gives us more spiritual experience.
</p>


<p>
The way that inner meditation leads to spiritual development is cultivating life energy inside our body.

The process starts with the bottom of the torso.

When life energy is enhanced and preserved, it automatically goes up along the spine and other channels.

Then we develop more energy in internal organs such as the heart and kidneys.

Afterwards, it goes up again, and we move practice centers up too.

At certain levels, it reaches the brain, and we also train our brain more to become aware of any subtle mind activities.

With the highly charged life energy, the brain will open up itself and presents us spiritual experience that the brain never generates before including spiritual enlightenment.
</p>


<p>In this framework of meditation, we can roughly draw a line between mastering practice techniques and starting to perceive that the life energy becomes strong enough at the bottom of the torso to move up.

Before the line, a person needs to learn the basics and keep practicing them.
