Inner meditation is a particularly beneficial practice.

You look at, listen to, and concentrate on the insides of your own self
by applying few basic techniques in concert, such as good body posture,
proper breathing methods, relaxation, and mental power.

It brings all your attention and awareness inward and circulates energy
flows inside your body.
</p>

<p>
This triggers profound changes in the body and the brain.

It develops and improves body energy flow, also known as <em>qi</em> (pronounce chee). 

The development of qi within your own body enhances health,
generates a sense of calm and well-being, and replenishes inner energy reserves.

Furthermore, it develops awareness and consciousness based on improved body conditions,
and this leads you along on a path of spiritual enlightenment.
