<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
There are many good meditation practices, and a particular type is inner meditation.

Unlike some techniques that use music or imagination of external images to help meditating, inner meditation emphasizes focusing on internal parts of a human body, watching to the parts and listening to the parts, namely, concentrating inward on something, not outside.
<!---->
It applies few fundamental techniques including breath, concentration, relaxation, body postures, and mental power to develop life energy, or <em>qi</em>.
<!---->
The development of qi inside one's body enhances overall wellness of health and meanwhile leads to a path of spiritual enlightenment.

<p>
Bringing all attention inward will cause profound changes to our body and mind  gradually.
<!---->
It develops a human's awareness.
<!---->
Being aware of internal states of the body and mind is of great power, because it represents the starting point of transforming one's negative emotion to positive energy.
<!---->
When combined with conscious will power, the awareness is one of the most effective ways to cultivate life energy or qi; the qi in turns enhances the awareness.
