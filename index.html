Inner meditation is a particularly beneficial practice.

It concentrates inward, not outside, namely, it focuses your attention and awareness on internal places of your body.

This contrasts to some meditation styles that require music or imagination of external images.

In inner meditation, you look at, listen to, and feel the insides of you own self by applying few basic techniques in concert, including breath, concentration, relaxation, good body posture, and mental power.

<p>
Bringing all attention inward triggers profound changes in the body and the brain.

It develops and improves our energy flow, also known as <em>qi</em> (pronounce chee).

The development of qi within yourself enhances health, generates a sense of calm and well-being, and replenishes inner energy reserves.

Further, it develops awareness and consciousness based on improved body conditions, and this leads you along on a path of spiritual enlightenment.
