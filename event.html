<h2 class="section-title">Classes</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.artsunitymovements.com/aum-center/">Arts Unity Movements Center</a> kindly provides a venue for teaching inner meditation practices.

Three classes are available.

The first one is <strong>Basics of Inner Meditation</strong>.

It provides students with detailed, step-by-step instructions of how to practice inner meditation.

Its goal is to allow students to practice on their own after the class.
</p>

<p>
The second class is <strong>Intermediate Inner Meditation</strong>.

It targets to people who have practiced meditation intensively (not limited to inner meditation) and want to keep at or advance to certain levels.

The minimum requirement for this class is that a participant can meditate by herself for 45 minutes without requiring any instructions.

This class does not provide detailed meditation instructions; instead, a person simply joins the class group and practices the way he normally does.

After the practice we will offer useful tips and suggestions that help him advance his meditation.

From time to time we will introduce some special topics and practice them.
</p>

<p>The third class is <strong>Half Day Meditation Retreat</strong>.

This is a special event for advanced practitioners who want to merge into deep meditation states.

It consists of four meditation sessions with each 45 minutes followed by a 15-minute break.

This event runs for about four hours.
