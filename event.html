<h2 class="section-title">Classes</h2>

<p>
We offer two classes at different levels.

The first one is <strong>Basics of Inner Meditation</strong> in which we guide you through practices step by step, with the goal of helping you be able to repeat it on your own after the class.

The class is about one hour, but your own practice session may range from 15 to 30 minutes like most beginners.
</p>


<p>
The second one is <strong>Meditation Retreat</strong>.

It is for experienced meditation practitioners who want to have a prolonged period of time to develop their body and mind. The idea is to create an environment in which you may merge into deep meditation states, discover and enjoy profound connections inside you and the universe. Please read the following instructions before RSVPing.

<ul>
<li>The entire retreat runs for about 4 hours. It consists of 4 sessions with each being 40 minutes followed by a 20-minute break.

<li>The first session starts at 2:45pm, and the next three sessions start at 3:45pm, 4:45pm, and 5:45pm, respectively.

<li>We start with body stretch at 2:30pm as warm-up for upcoming sessions.

<li>We ring a bell at the start and end of each session. We also ring a bell two minutes before the start of a session so that you can go to your mat in time.

<li> Please make every effort to keep your meditation states during breaks. You may walk, practice yoga, or stretch to release tension or soreness in your body, but these activities should not interrupt your meditation.

<li> If you do not want to take a break, then feel free to continue your practice during the break. We purposely make this a retreat environment to minimize interruptions and distractions.

<li> We suggest you to bring and use your eye cover and earplugs to turn this retreat into a dark and silent meditation experience. A dark and quiet environment minimizes external sensory stimulus and makes it easy to focus on insides of your body.

<li> During the retreat please refrain from talking, using a cell phone, reading, etc. because these activities may interrupt your and other people's meditation.

<li> If it's difficult for you to take the entire retreat, say you want to meditate for one session, then we encourage you to join the body stretch and the first session. You can peacefully leave the retreat after the first session.

<li> You may join a session during a break. Once a session starts, please do not join it. You should wait until it finishes. Then you may join the next session.

<li> You may leave the retreat during a break. Please do not do it during meditation sessions because it may interrupt other people's practices.

<li> Minimum requirement: the minimum length of practice is one session, so you must be able to meditate for 40 minutes.

</ul>
