<h2 class="section-title">Classes</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.artsunitymovements.com/aum-center/">Arts Unity Movements Center</a> kindly provides a venue for teaching inner meditation.
</p>

<p>
Three classes are available.

The first one is <strong>Basics of Inner Meditation</strong> in which we will guide participants to go through meditation sessions step by step, with the goal of helping you be able to practice on your own after the class.

The class is about one hour, but your own practice session may range from 15 to 30 minutes like most beginners.
</p>

<p>
The second one is <strong>Intermediate Inner Meditation</strong>.

This class does not provide detailed instructions.

Instead, you simply join the class group and practice the way you normally does.

At the end of the class, we will offer useful tips and suggestions that help you advance your practice.

From time to time we will introduce and practice some special topics.

The minimum requirement for this class is that you can meditate by yourself for at least 40 minutes without requiring any instructions.

This class is also around one hour.
</p>

<p>
The third one is <strong>Half Day Meditation Retreat</strong>.

This is for advanced practitioners who want to merge their body and mind into deep meditation states.

It consists of four sessions with each being 45 minutes followed by a 15-minute break.

The entire event runs for about four hours and is called half day retreat.

During the half day period of time, you quiet down and focus on yourself, leaving any worldly attachment out of you.

It's a fantastic way to recharge yourself with Qi.
