<h2 class="section-title">Classes</h2>

<p>
We offer two classes at different levels.

The first one is <strong>Basics of Inner Meditation</strong> in which we guide you through practice sessions step by step, with the goal of helping you be able to practice on your own after the class.

The class is about one hour, but your own practice session may range from 15 to 30 minutes like most beginners.
</p>


<p>
The second one is <strong>Half Day Meditation Retreat</strong>.

It is for experienced meditators who want to have a prolonged period of time to develop their body and mind. Please read the following instructions before RSVPing.

<ul>
<li>The entire retreat runs for about 4 hours. It consists of 4 meditation sessions with each being 40 minutes followed by a 20-minute break.

<li>The first session starts at 8:45am, and the next three sessions start at 9:45am, 10:45am, and 11:45am, respectively.

<li>We start with body stretch at 8:30am, which facilitates a sitting posture.

<li>We ring a bell at the start and end of each session. We also ring a bell three minutes before the start of a session so that you can go to your mat in time.

<li>Please make every effort to keep your meditation states during breaks. In the breaks, you may practice walking meditation, yoga, or stretch to release tension or sore in your body, but your mind should continue meditating.

<li>If you do not want to stop during a break, then feel free to continue your practice during the break. We purposely make this a retreat environment to minimize interruptions and distractions.

<li>The idea is to create an environment for a half day retreat in which you may merge into deep meditation states, synchronize your body and mind, discover and enjoy deep connections inside you and among you, us, and the universe.

<li>We suggest you to bring and use your eye cover and earplugs to turn this retreat into a dark and silent meditation experience. A dark and silent environment minimizes external sensory stimuli and makes it easy to focus insides of your body. 

<li>During the retreat please refrain from talking, using a cell phone, reading, etc.&nbsp;because these activities may interrupt your and other people's meditation.

<li>If you have questions or concerns about meditation or the event during the retreat, please talk to the retreat organizer.

<li>If it's difficult for you to take the entire retreat, say you want to meditate for one session, then we encourage you to join the body stretch and the first session. You can peacefully leave the retreat after the first session.

<li>You may join a session during a break. Once a session starts, please do not join it. You should wait until it finishes. Then you may join the next session.

<li>You may leave the retreat during a break. Please do not do it during meditation sessions because it may interrupt other people's meditation.

<li>Minimum requirement: the minimum length of practice is one session, so you must be able to meditate for 40 minutes. 

</ul>
