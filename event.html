<h2 class="section-title">Classes</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.artsunitymovements.com/aum-center/">Arts Unity Movements Center</a> kindly provides a venue for teaching inner meditation practices.

Two classes are available.

The first one is <strong>Basics of Inner Meditation</strong>, which is like knowing ABC for learning English.

It provides students with detailed, step-by-step instructions of how to practice inner meditation.

Its goal is to teach useful techniques so that students will be able to practice on their own after the class.
</p>

<p>
The second class is <strong>Intermediate Inner Meditation</strong>.

As its name suggests, it targets to people who have practiced inner meditation extensively and want to keep at or advance to certain levels.

The minimum requirement for this class is that a person can meditate by herself for 45 minutes without requiring any instructions.

This class does not provide detailed instructions of how to practice meditation; instead, a person simply joins the class group and practices the way he normally does.

From time to time, the class will introduce and practise some special topics or techniques.
